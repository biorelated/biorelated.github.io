  Hey! My name is George, author and editor of this blog. I am about to complete my PhD thesis. I have a keen interest in different scientific and social
  topics.

  I plan to use this blog as a notebook of technical and amusing topics that I come across, contributed to and find useful. The views and opinions 
  expressed here are my own and do not represent research groups or institutions that I work with.
