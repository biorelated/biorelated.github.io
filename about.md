Hey!  Thank you for stopping by!

My name is George. I have a keen interest in scientific and technical topics.

I use this blog as a notebook for technical and amusing topics that I come across, contributed to and find useful. The views and opinions 
expressed here are my own and do not represent those of individuals, research groups or institutions that I work with.
