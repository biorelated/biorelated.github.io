  Hey! My name is George. Lone author and editor of this blog! I am sluggishly completing my PhD thesis. I have a keen interest in various topics
  ranging from physics, biology, mathematics and philosophy. I am not good at all of them and hence this biorelated blog. 
</p>

I plan to use this blog as a notebook of technical and amusing topics that I come across, contributed to and find useful. The views and opinions 
expressed here are my own and do not represent research groups or institutions that I work with.
