It would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense; 
it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure.

My good friend Siwo, discussed some limitations of science in a [blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-limits-science-key-solving-grand-challenges-siwo?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST).
He outlined limitations that emanate from human nature, 
limits in current knowledge, and the extent of observable and 
measurable universe. Some authorities claim that the limits science lie in the inability to:

* Assess the aesthetic value of an object,
* Measure morality, and
* Account for the supernatural

Aesthetics, morality and supernatural concepts emerge to preserve or structure a community. More often they propagate a strongly held opinion that strengthens social-political and geopolitical interests and agenda.
The supernatural as an abstract concept explains natural phenomena and is riddled with unchallenged dogma. But dogma is not limited to the supernatural, it forms a central component of the scientific method. The difference is that scientific dogma is open to criticism and is reviewed in the light of new data, evidence or proof.

Humans make observations and measurements based that are dependent on their senses and brain interpretation of the world or universe if you like. What cannot be observed and measured directly is often interpreted as "abstract", or "non-existent". The limit to understanding our universe is in the extent to which we can "visualize" the abstract. And that is why mathematical tools
are indispensable in understanding the laws that govern the universe. The abstract notions and equations yield novel theories, insights and perspectives.

The human mind is a fantastic logical machine but is limited by number of calculations it can process per unit time.
But now we have powerful numerical machines that are a cause of excitement and concern and that are going to stir 
the moral and cultural pot for a while.
