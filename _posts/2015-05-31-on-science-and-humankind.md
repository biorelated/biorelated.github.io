title: On Science and humankind

It would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no sense; 
it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure.

My good friend Siwo, discussed some limitations of science in a [blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-limits-science-key-solving-grand-challenges-siwo?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST)
He outlined some limitations of science
that emanate from what he referred to as the fundamental human nature, 
limits of our current knowledge, and the extent of observable and 
measurable universe. Some authorities claim that the limits science lie in the inability to:

* Assess the aesthetic value of an object,
* Measure morality, and
* Account for the supernatural

Aesthetics, morality and supernatural concepts emerge as intrinsic evolutionary traits and act in the interest of preserving or structuring a community.
The supernatural is often an abstract concept to explain natural phenomena. Unfortunately it falls prey to dogma. Dogma is not unique 
to the supernatural, it is part of the scientific method. However, scientific dogma is open to criticism and is often reviewed in the light of new evidence and proof.

Humans use basic senses to put into perspective what they can observe or measure. Anything that falls off the senses is described as abstract purely because we cannot fathom it with our basic senses. Often we may describe such concepts as difficult and at worst discard or refute them.
The limit to understanding our universe is in the extent to which we can "visualize" the abstract. Mathematics is indispensable in 
understanding the laws that govern the known universe. Equations push the limits of the abstract and the unconventional, invent new symbols
and yield new insights and perspectives. 

In the past the human mind has placed a bottleneck on the number of calculations and logical units we could process per unit time.
We have now invented numerical machines that overcome this hurdle. It is both a cause for excitement and concern.
