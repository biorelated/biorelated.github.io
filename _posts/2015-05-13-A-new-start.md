"Sometimes it's important to work for that pot of gold. But other times it's essential to take time off and to make sure that your most important decision in the day simply consists of choosing which color to slide down on the rainbow."
â€• Douglas Pagels, These Are the Gifts I'd Like to Give to You: A Sourcebook of Joy and Encouragement

Over the last couple of years, I have learnt a lot, I have made mistakes and sometimes missed opportunities. It is refreshing to "burn" the past, to start on a "clean slate".
A few old slates are difficult to totally discard.

I took bold steps to enroll on a PhD program, fall in love, start a family and finish the PhD program even when funding was exhausted. Now I am very close to submitting the written thesis.

During this period, I have interacted with some of the smartest and gifted people in the world and made life long friends with very talented persons. I have travelled a little and found amazing people, places and cultures. My greatest journey has been fatherhood. It is far from over and I hope to chronicle relevant bits and pieces here. 

Along the way, I have missed a few opportunities; the startup company that I declined to join, the startup ideas that I never followed or completed and the friendships that I let decay.

It is easy to consider life as a blue or a red pill, But I think it is better to prefer the daily excitement, appreciate the uncertainty of life, grapple chaos and usher the illusion of order.
