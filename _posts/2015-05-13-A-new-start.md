Over the last couple of years, I have learnt a lot, I have made mistakes and sometimes missed opportunities. It is refreshing to "burn" the past, to start on a "clean slate".
Old slates cannot be fully discarded though.

It took bold steps to enroll on a PhD program, fall in love, start a family and finish the PhD program even when funding was exhausted. Now I am very close to submitting the written thesis.

During this period, I have interacted with some of the smartest and gifted people in the world and made life long friends with very talented persons. I have travelled a little and found amazing people, places and cultures. My greatest journey has been fatherhood. It is far from over and I hope to chronicle relevant bits and pieces here. 

Along the way, I have missed a few opportunities; The startup company that I declined to join. The startup ideas that I never followed or completed. The friendships that I let decay

Some people prefer to think of life as a blue or a red pill, others prefer the daily excitement, the uncertainty of nature and the chaos that usher an orderly illusion. A fresh start.
