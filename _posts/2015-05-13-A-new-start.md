title: A fresh start
---
Over the last couple of years, I have learnt a lot, made mistakes and missed new opportunities. It feels refreshing to "burn" the past, start on a clean slate. It is important not to forget reasons.

I took a bold step to start on a PhD programme. I took a bold step to fall in love. I took a bold step to start a family and I took a bold step to finish the PhD programme even when funding was halted. Now I am sluggishly close to submitting the thesis. There is a lot to reflect on! 

I have interracted with some of the smartest  and gifted people in the world and made life long friends with very talented persons. I have travelled a bit and found new places and cultures. My greatest journey has been fatherhood. It is far from over and I hope to chronicle relevant bits and pieces here. 

And the same time I have missed a few opportnunities; The startup company that I declined to join. The startup ideas that I never completed. Friendships that decayed.  

We like to think that life is a blue or the red pill.  I think the pills are presented with a blindfold. Maybe there is no blue or red pill.
