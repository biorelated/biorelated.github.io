title: A fresh start
---
Over the last couple of years, I have learnt a lot, made mistakes and missed new opportunities. It feels refreshing to "burn" the past, start on a clean slate. It is important not to forget reasons.

I took a bold step to start on a PhD programme. I took a bold step to fall in love. I took a bold step to start a family and I took a bold step to finish the PhD programme even when funding was halted. Now I am sluggishly close to submitting the thesis. There is a lot to reflect on! 

I have interracted with some of the smartest  and gifted people in the world and made life long friends with very talented persons. I have travelled a bit and found new places and cultures. My greatest journey has been fatherhood. It is far from over and I hope to chronicle relevant bits and pieces here. 

And the same time I have missed a few opportnunities, the startup company that asked me to join them but I declined. My startup ideas that I never had time to complete. Lost a couple of friendships as well. 

The reality of life is that you take either the blue or the red pill wearing a blind fold. Maybe there is no blue or red pill.
