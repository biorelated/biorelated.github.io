title: A fresh start
---
Over the last couple of years, I have learnt a lot, I have made mistakes and I have missed nice opportunities. It feels refreshing to "burn" the past, to start on a "clean slate". It is important not to forget why the previous slates were discarded.

I took a bold step to enroll on a PhD program. I took a bold step to fall in love. I took a bold step to start a family and I took a bold step to finish the PhD programme even when funding was exhausted. Now I am sluggishly close to submitting the thesis. 

I have interracted with some of the smartest and gifted people in the world and made life long friends with very talented persons. I have travelled a bit and found new places and cultures. My greatest journey has been fatherhood. It is far from over and I hope to chronicle relevant bits and pieces here. 

At the same time I have missed a few opportnunities; The startup company that I declined to join. The startup ideas that I never followed or completed. The friendships that I let decay.  

Some people prefer to think of life as a blue or a red pill, others prefer the daily excitement, the uncertainity of nature and the chaos that give an illusion of order. A fresh start.
